# AI Course Repository

## Course Objective
This repository showcases a collection of practical work completed as part of the Artificial Intelligence course at North East University Bangladesh. It includes algorithm implementations, game development using AI logic, and projects involving modern AI tools for content generation and educational presentation.

## Key Takeaways from the Course
- Practiced implementing key AI algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Best-First Search, Min-Max, Alpha-Beta Pruning, and AO*.
- Created interactive games like Nim and Tic-Tac-Toe, integrating those algorithms for decision-making.
- Explored cutting-edge AI tools to develop course-related presentations and video content.
- Applied theoretical AI concepts through hands-on programming and real-world problem-solving.

## AI Tools Integration
This folder contains the final deliverables showcasing the application of AI tools for creating course-related multimedia content.

### Components
- **Video Project:**  
  A course overview video combining theory and lab demonstrations, created using tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and InVideo AI. Script writing and editing were supported by AI.  
  [See detailed steps in `AI Tools Exploration/Video/README.md`](AI Tools Exploration/Video/README.md).

- **Presentation Slides:**  
  A comprehensive slide deck covering theory and lab activities. Slides were designed using Gemma AI after content generation with ChatGPT and Gemini.  
  [See more in `AI Tools Exploration/Presentation_README.md`](AI Tools Exploration/Presentation_README.md).

### Tools Utilized
- ChatGPT (DeepAI)
- Google Gemini
- InVideo AI
- Gemma AI ([gemma.app](https://gemma.app))
